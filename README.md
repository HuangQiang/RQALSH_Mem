# RQALSH_Mem: Memory Version of RQALSH and RQALSH*

Version: 1.0.0

Release date: 23-04-2018


Introduction
--------

This package is written in the C++ programming language. It provides two 
internal LSH schemes RQALSH and RQALSH* for c-Approximate Furthest Neighbor 
(or simply c-AFN) search under Euclidean distance.

Usage
--------

We provide a Makefile and a script (i.e., run_mnist.sh) as a running example 
for comipling and running this package. Before start running this package, 
please ensure the input format of the dataset and query set is correct. We 
provide a sample dataset and query set (i.e., Mnist) for your reference.

We also provide the scripts (i.e., run_sift.sh, run_gist.sh, run_trevi.sh,
run_p53.sh, and run_para.sh) for the users who would like to reproduce our 
results presented in ICDE 2017 and TKDE 2017. The datasets Sift, Gist, Trevi, 
and P53 we used can be downloaded from the following links:
